## Simple todo

- [ ] Simplify API, add the ability to add a clip directly to a composition, or a clip to a scene, etc.
- [ ] Merge start + end on a clip into a single property. Possible rename, it is not clear that that is on the track it self.
- [ ] Add jsdoc comments to the code
- [ ] Reorder scenes, tracks, clips, etc.
- [ ] Allow something like a backdrop to be added at the same level as a scene, so we don't need to add it to each scene.
- [ ] Add audio support
- [ ] Improve 1x video playback, by using the pixi.js VideoResource
